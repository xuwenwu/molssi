        "\n",
        "*   A 2x2x2 supercell of FCC copper containing 8 atoms was successfully created using the `make_supercell` function with a 3x3 transformation matrix.\n",
        "*   The Effective Medium Theory (EMT) potential was successfully applied to the copper supercell.\n",
        "*   The initial potential energy of the unrelaxed supercell was calculated to be -0.0455 eV.\n",
        "*   A structural relaxation using the FIRE algorithm was performed, resulting in a relaxed potential energy of -0.0455 eV. This indicates the initial structure was already close to its minimum energy configuration under the EMT potential.\n",
        "*   The cohesive energy per atom for the copper supercell, calculated from the relaxed structure and the EMT potential (where the energy of an isolated atom is zero), was found to be -0.0057 eV/atom.\n",
        "*   A short molecular dynamics simulation using the Langevin algorithm was successfully set up and run for 1000 steps at 300 K.\n",
        "*   The energy (potential, kinetic, total) and temperature data from the molecular dynamics simulation were successfully extracted from the `md.log` file and plotted over time, illustrating the system's dynamic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The calculated cohesive energy per atom of -0.0057 eV/atom provides a fundamental property of copper under the EMT potential, representing the energy required to dissociate the crystal into isolated atoms. This value can be compared with experimental data or values obtained from other potentials to assess the accuracy of the EMT potential for describing copper's cohesive properties.\n",
        "*   The molecular dynamics simulation and its analysis demonstrate the system's stability at 300 K under the EMT potential. Further analysis of the trajectory could include calculating radial distribution functions or diffusion coefficients to investigate the structural and dynamic properties of the copper supercell at finite temperatures.\n"
