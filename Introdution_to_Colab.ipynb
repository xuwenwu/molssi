        "# 2.  Executed Python code in Colab cells.\n",
        "# 3.  Installed a Python library (`MDAnalysis`).\n",
        "# 4.  Downloaded a data file.\n",
        "# 5.  Loaded a molecular dynamics simulation trajectory.\n",
        "# 6.  Inspected the number of atoms and frames.\n",
        "# 7.  Iterated through frames.\n",
        "# 8.  Selected specific groups of atoms.\n",
        "# 9.  Performed a basic analysis (center of mass).\n",
        "# 10. (Optionaly) Visualized the molecule.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# This is just a tiny glimpse into what you can do with computational materials science and molecular dynamics. As you continue your course, you'll learn how to set up and run your *own* simulations and perform much more complex analyses.\n",

        "# Don't worry if some of the concepts feel a bit abstract right now. The best way to learn is by doing. Experiment with the code cells, try changing numbers or selection strings (e.g., try `\"water\"` instead of `\"protein\"` if water is present, although in this specific example it might not be).\n",

        "# Congratulations! You've completed this introductory tutorial to materials simulation in Google Colab. You've taken your first steps in:\n",
        "#\n",
        "# *   **Understanding Google Colab and Jupyter Notebooks:** You learned about text and code cells and how to execute them in a web browser environment.\n",
        "# *   **Basic Python:** You practiced using the `print()` function and learned about variables and fundamental data types like strings, integers, and floats.\n",
        "# *   **Using Libraries and Installation:** You saw how powerful libraries are for specialized tasks and learned how to install them using `pip`.\n",
        "# *   **Creating Atomic Structures:** You used `ase` to build a single crystal copper unit cell.\n",
        "# *   **Saving Structures:** You learned how to save the created structure to a PDB file using `ase.io.write`.\n",
        "# *   **Loading and Basic Analysis:** You loaded the saved structure into `MDAnalysis` and performed a simple analysis by counting the atoms.\n",
        "# *   **Attempting Visualization:** We attempted to visualize the structures using `nglview`. While we encountered some environment challenges that prevented the visualization from displaying correctly in this specific setup, it's important to know that visualization is a powerful tool in materials science, and `nglview` is a common library used for this purpose. Environment issues can sometimes occur in computational environments, and troubleshooting is a normal part of the process.\n",

        "#\n",
        "# *   **Explore `ase` further:** Learn how to create larger supercells, different crystal structures, and add defects using `ase`. Look into visualizing structures directly with `ase` or other tools (perhaps in a different environment if `nglview` continues to be challenging).\n",
        "# *   **Dive deeper into `MDAnalysis`:** Explore how to select specific groups of atoms based on various criteria, calculate properties like distances, angles, and dynamics, and work with actual simulation trajectories (sequences of frames over time).\n",
        "# *   **Learn about Molecular Dynamics Simulations:** Understand the principles behind MD simulations, how to set up and run them using software like LAMMPS or GROMACS, and how to use `MDAnalysis` to analyze the resulting trajectories.\n",
        "# *   **Continue to Practice Python:** Keep practicing your Python skills by working through online tutorials or coding challenges. The more comfortable you are with Python, the easier it will be to use libraries like `ase` and `MDAnalysis`.\n",
        "# *   **Experiment:** Don't be afraid to modify the code in this tutorial, try out different parameters, or explore the documentation for `ase` and `MDAnalysis` to see what else they can do.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Keep experimenting and building on what you've learned. Happy simulating!"

        "*   Fundamental Python concepts like `print()`, variables (string, integer, float), and data types are essential for writing simulation scripts.\n",
        "*   Python libraries like `ase` and `MDAnalysis` provide specialized tools for building, manipulating, and analyzing atomic structures.\n",
        "*   Libraries can be installed in Colab using `pip` commands prefixed with `!`.\n",
        "*   The `ase.build.bulk()` function is effective for creating standard crystal structures like FCC copper unit cells.\n",
        "*   Atomic structures created with `ase` can be saved to standard file formats like PDB using `ase.io.write()`.\n",
        "*   `MDAnalysis` can load atomic structures from files (e.g., PDB) into a `Universe` object for analysis.\n",
